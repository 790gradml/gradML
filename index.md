# Course Overview


- Graduate-level general introduction to machine learning; offered in fall semesters only; 12 units (3-0-9)
- Prerequisites:
  - Linear algebra (at the level of [18.06](https://github.com/mitmath/1806) or [18.C06](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/16629))
  - Probability (at the level of 6.3700, 6.3800, or [18.600](https://math.mit.edu/~sheffield/spring2022math600.html))
- Recommended prerequisites: [6.3900](https://introml.mit.edu/spring23/calendar), 6.C01, [6.S898](https://phillipi.github.io/6.s898/), or other previous experience in machine learning.
- Brief description: Principles, techniques, and algorithms in machine learning from the point of view of statistical inference; representation, generalization, and model selection; and methods such as linear models, Bayesian networks, and deep learning models. The focus in fall23 is on generative models and reinforcement learning.
- Course components: We'll have weekly lectures and recitations (see [Schedule](/info/schedule/) for details). Complementing those are homework, project, and exam(s). For the exam(s), while the exact time is TBC, they will be before Monday, December 18, 2023 (i.e. we won't have an exam during MIT's final exam period).
- Course number change: Since fall22, all MIT EECS subjects have been renumbered (rationale and details can be found [here](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/subject-numbering/)). This subject used to be called 6.867; moving forward, it will be 6.790, eventually. But for registration purposes, please register for **6.7900** (note the extra trailing zero) during this current transition phase.
