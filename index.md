# Course Overview

- Graduate-level Machine Learning Introduction
- 12 units (3-0-9)
- Prerequisites:
  - Linear algebra (at the level of 18.06)
  - Probability (at the level of 6.3700, 6.3800, or 18.600)
- Recommended prerequisites: [6.3900](https://introml.mit.edu/spring23/calendar), 6.C01, [6.S898](https://phillipi.github.io/6.s898/), or other previous experience in machine learning.
