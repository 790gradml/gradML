Staff pictures:
- place your photos under the `assets/images/` folder
- find your entry under the `_staffers/<name.md>`
- change the line `photo: <name of your photo>`

Typesetting Notes:
- single dollar sign vs double dollar signs
- when using {": . } for class label (styling), line break matters. If want to keep everything under the "blob", we need to use `<br>` tag instead of a natural line break
- conditional probability type setting is finicky. sometimes we need to do $\mathbb{P}(X_j\|Y)$ -- note the `\|` -- instead of $\mathbb{P}(X_j|Y)$.
