## Developer Setup
(very much WIP...)

All commands below should be run as command-line shell commands. (e.g. on Mac, you run these commands in the App `Terminal` (a built-in app), or `iterm2` (a popular alternative))

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shensquared/gradML.git`
2. (Important) `cd` to the directory of your clone of this repo
3. Install [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) (see https://github.com/shensquared/gradML/pull/11 for some details)
4. Install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com): `gem install bundler jekyll`
5. Install all this repo's specific dependencies `bundle install` 
6. Get the site running locally via `bundle exec jekyll serve`
7. Open your browser, and go to http://localhost:4000; you should see something that looks familiar ðŸ¥³
