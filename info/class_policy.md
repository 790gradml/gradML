# Cross-registration

We follow MIT's calendar, and do not have additional extensions or accommodations based on home university calendar. Especially important will be for you to plan ahead for our in-person exam. We'll have one exam (time/place TBD; surely before Monday Dec 18). We'll not have a final exam during MIT's final exam period.

All students need a Kerberos to interact with MIT systems (e.g. the Registrar). Cross-registered students will receive their Kerberos once the registration goes through; however, the process can take a while. We therefore strongly encourage you to cross register early, if possible, to avoid any delayed access.

If you're not familiar with MIT campus, you might find the [whereis](https://whereis.mit.edu) site helpful.

# Listener
Due to capacity and other constraints, we will not be able to accept Listener
registrants in 6.7900 GradML this semester.

# Late Policy

# Collaboration

We encourage students to discuss assignments in this subject with
other students and with the teaching staff to better understand the
concepts.  However, everything you hand in on-line or off-line must be your own work, as it's also critical for your individual learning to
be sure you devote concentrated independent effort to solving all the
problems.

The correct model is to discuss solution strategies and write your solutions individually. Implementations that are identical or differ only by variable names will not receive full credit.


# GradSupport

For graduate students, a variety of issues may impact your academic career including faculty/student relationships, funding, and interpersonal concerns. In the Office of Graduate Education (OGE), GradSupport provides consultation, coaching, and advocacy to graduate students on matters related to academic and life challenges. If you are dealing with an issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you may contact GradSupport by email at <a href="mailto:gradsupport@mit.edu">gradsupport@mit.edu</a>
or via phone at (617) 253-4860. More info can be found at [GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/).

# Student Support Services
For undergrad students, if you are dealing with a personal or medical issue that is impacting your ability to attend class, complete work, or take an exam, you should contact a dean in Student Support Services (S3). S3 is here to help you. The deans will verify your situation, provide you with support, and help you work with your professor or instructor to determine next steps. In most circumstances, you will not be excused from coursework without verification from a dean. Please visit the [S3 website](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3) for contact information and more ways that they can provide support.


# Disability and Access Services
We are committed to the principle of equal access, and we are more
than willing to make arrangements to help accommodate students with
disabilities or related challenges. In general, knowing about the kind
of help you need earlier in the semester means that we'll be better
prepared to provide that help effectively, in coordination
with Disability and Access Services.
If you have a disability and are not planning to use accommodations,
it is still recommended that you meet with DAS staff to familiarize
yourself with their services and resources. If you have been approved
for accommodations by DAS, 6.790 staff are ready to assist with
implementation. 

Please send these approved requests to
<a href="mailto:6.790-instructors@mit.edu">6.790-instructors@mit.edu</a>
to inform us, and we will work to implement these accommodations.

# Mental Health
MIT is a challenging environment, and 6.790 is a challenging course.  As such,
it is normal to expect some level of stress (and a lot of hard work) during
6.790.  A certain level of stress is healthy and is part of the learning
process (if it were easy, you probably wouldn't be learning much!).  However,
too much stress can be a bad thing, and if you are feeling overwhelmed, we want
to help, so please don't hesitate to reach out.

Additionally, if you or someone you know is struggling with mental health
issues (including significant stress, mood changes, excessive worry,
substance/alcohol abuse, or problems with eating or sleeping), we strongly
encourage you to contact or visit one or more of the following resources, who
may be able to provide additional guidance and support:

* [GradSupport](https://oge.mit.edu/development/gradsupport/)
* [Student Support Services](https://studentlife.mit.edu/s3)
* [MIT Medical: Student Mental Health and Counseling](https://medical.mit.edu/services/mental-health-counseling)
