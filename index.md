## Course Overview

- Probabilistic foundations of machine learning; offered in fall semesters; 12 units (3-0-9)
- Prerequisites:
  - Introductory machine learning (at the level of [6.390](https://introml.mit.edu) or [6.370](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6c.html#6.3700) or [6.C01](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6e.html#6.C01))
  - Linear algebra (at the level of [18.06](https://github.com/mitmath/1806) or [18.C06](https://canvas.mit.edu/courses/16629))
  - Probability (at the level of [6.3700](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-041-probabilistic-systems-analysis-and-applied-probability-fall-2010/pages/readings/), [6.3800](http://student.mit.edu/catalog/m6c.html#6.3800), or [18.600](https://math.mit.edu/~sheffield/spring2022math600.html))
- Brief description: Probabilistic thinking is critical to understanding machine learning, in techniques ranging from classic linear models to modern deep networks.  We will study model representation, generalization, learning algorithms, and model-selection with mathematical rigor as well as an emphasis on how to apply these methods in applications with real-world consequence.
- A syllabus can be found [here](/info/calendar)

## Course Components

We will have weekly lectures (schedule details can be found [here](/info/schedule/)); complementing those are written homework, small projects, a midterm, and a final exam.

Homeworks, projects, and lecture notes will be poseted on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/mit/fall2025/67900).

## Course Number Change

Since Fall 22, all MIT EECS subjects have been renumbered (rationale and details can be found [here](https://www.eecs.mit.edu/academics/subject-numbering/)). This subject used to be called 6.867; moving forward, it will be 6.790, eventually. But for registration purposes, please register for **6.7900** (note the extra trailing zero) during this current transition phase.
