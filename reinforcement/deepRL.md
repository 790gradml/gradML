- Considerations when choosing an algo
    - Sample complexity
    - The use of a model
        
        (emphasize the model here differs from the hypothesis model; in RL and control context, model typically refers to the dynamics model. the usual ML hypothesis or model is typically a policy, or a value function)
    <!-- - Whether the dynamics model is super discrete -->
