This is a set of warm-up problems, divided into two parts. *There is no
need to turn in this homework. We will post solutions.*

Problems in the first part constitute a quick diagnostic, to see if your
background in linear algebra and probability is adequate to do well in
the course. If these problems are not fairly easy for you, then you
should probably take the relevant courses this term and take 6.790 next
year.

Problems in the second part are designed to help you learn some
“vectorized” programming strategies, which will help you create
efficient implementations of algorithms studied in class and also to
interface with existing libraries. We do not expect you to know how to
do this vectorization already, but ask you to spend some time in the
first week learning how to form elegant, efficient solutions to these
problems. You are welcome to use `numpy` and/or `scipy`.
