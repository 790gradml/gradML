# Grading

## Late Submission
## Collaboration

We encourage students to discuss assignments in this subject with
other students and with the teaching staff to better understand the
concepts.  However, everything you hand in on-line or off-line must be your own work, as it's also critical for your individual learning to
be sure you devote concentrated independent effort to solving all the
problems.

The correct model is to discuss solution strategies and write your solutions individually. Implementations that are identical or differ only by variable names will not receive full credit.
